# IRCpp
IRCpp is a simple IRC server implemented in C++, as a project in the subject of "Socket/Network Programming".

## Installation
Clone repository and execute commands below:
```bash
cd IRCpp
make
```
After that an executable **IRCpp** should appear.

## Usage
Just type:
```bash
./IRCpp
```
By default, the server is running on port **2137** (don't ask me why XD)

To use the server capabilities, you need to have the client.
Tests were carried out with [IRCClient](https://github.com/fredimachado/IRCClient).
